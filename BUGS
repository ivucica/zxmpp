== Upon restoring stream from JSON, we don't resend aborted HTTP requests

If we did not complete all connections, we need to go, resend requests and complete them now.
If we did not send all packets from queue successfully prior to serialization, we need to go and send them now.

We currently don't attempt to serialize or unserialize neither packets nor connections. That needs to be fixed.

Result: some packets may be dropped upon execution of serialization/deserialization.

== No user input sanitization

User can send whatever we want, and we interpret and just print out whatever we get. That's doubleplusungood.

Result: how about some javascript sent in a <message><body></body></message>? How about breaking the XML?
