== Outgoing out of order

Since after sending a packet  we don't wait for the hold connection to interrupt before sending next poll
packet, we may get disconnected for having our request-ids (rid) spread too far apart.

Result: incorrect behavior

== Incoming out of order

We don't guarantee that we will process the messages in order we transmitted them; in fact, we process the
packet as soon as it arrives. We don't queue the packets according to rids.

Result: Blatant XEP-0124 violation (see 14.2)
