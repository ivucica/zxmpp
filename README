This is an implementation of an XMPP client in Javascript. It uses BOSH concept 
of HTTP binding as defined by XEP-0124 and XEP-0206.

Goal is to have a backend library for doing XMPP, and a separate GUI that will
allow attaching an overlay over existing webpage, as well as almost transparent
reconnection upon unloading the page and reloading it.
