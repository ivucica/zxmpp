Z-XMPP License
==============

First, I'd like to point out that this custom, non-FLOSS license 
will be replaced by either AGPL or a BSD-styled license. For now,
I'm opening the repository and the client to get feedback.

Basically what I want is:
1. That you use Z-XMPP only noncommercially.
2. That if you publish changes anywhere, you grant me rights to use them
   in any way I want (a la GPL)
3. That you don't obfuscate the code
4. If you publish source code either by using Z-XMPP on a web site,
   or as a ZIP, or in a repository, that you notify zxmpp@vucica.net
   about it.

Now for the text written by a nonlawyer in a couple of minutes...
------
