= apache modules, .htaccess

Your apache installation needs to have mod_rewrite and mod_proxy enabled,
at least for the directory where you put zxmpp. We're shipping an example
.htaccess which redirects to a local XMPP server, with BOSH service being
run on port 5280 in subdirectory http-bind/ (as on ejabberd).
