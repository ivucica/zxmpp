## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please file an issue if you see a vulnerability.

Note that the number of deployments of this hobby library and its UI are very limited;
while all reports are welcome, unless it impacts one of the few deployments where it still
runs, the issue is unlikely to be addressed -- especially since it is written back in 2009
with very few bells and whistles which make Javascript easier to write these days, meaning
it might be tricky to appropriately address an issue.

Of course, a report is still welcome.
